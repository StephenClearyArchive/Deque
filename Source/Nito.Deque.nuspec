  <summary>A double-ended queue (deque), which provides O(1) indexed access, O(1) removals from the front and back, amortized O(1) insertions to the front and back, and O(N) insertions and removals anywhere else (with the operations getting slower as the index approaches the middle). This is a source package.</summary>
